## Hi there 👋

# Muhammad Usman | Data Scientist & Software Engineer

**"Code like a poet, think like a scientist, and debug like a detective."**  
👾 **Passionate about building impactful solutions** | 🔍 **Data-Driven Decision Making** | 🧑‍💻 **Turning ideas into scalable systems**

## 🔨 What I'm working on:
- **Data Science Projects**: Because I believe numbers never lie… well, except when they're cleaned.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Teaching computers how to think. (It's basically like teaching a cat how to fetch, but with more math.)
- **Software Engineering**: Building systems that scale, because 'it works on my machine' is not an option.

If you made it this far, congratulations – you just unlocked a badge of appreciation from me! 🎉
